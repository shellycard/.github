## 🚀 What is ShellyCard?

ShellyCard is a **digital punchcard app** designed for SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses).

It allows businesses to **reward customers** with rebates, points, gifts, or any form of loyalty benefit they choose.  
Using **QR codes**, businesses can identify returning customers easily — and customers can scan businesses to track their rewards.

Perfect for:
- Cafes, barbers, salons, and local shops
- Freelancers and independent service providers
- Anyone offering recurring services and looking to build customer retention

ShellyCard is:
- 🌐 Multi-language (🇺🇸 English + 🇮🇱 Hebrew)
